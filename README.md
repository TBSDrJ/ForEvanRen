Some Notes on Bermoulli Numbers for Evan Ren.

Right now, there are three files:
1. My dissertation.  Pages 32-26 and 106-109 are of primary interest to us.
2. NotesOnBernoulliNumbers.tex
3. NotesOnBernoulliNumbers.pdf

The latter two files are my trying to help you understand the problem, and think aloud about what you'll actually do with it.

Another reference is: www.bernoulli.org hosted by Bernd Kellner, who I corresponded with some back when we were both graduate students.  Back then, I chose not to use v1 of his calcbn program, but I don't entirely remember why.
